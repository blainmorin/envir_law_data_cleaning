# Data Cleaning

We can decide if this system works for everyone, but my thought is to have separate scripts for each data cleaning task. Contribute your work to your folder, then we can call them from the master_clean.R file.

* Remember to pull before you push!



# Master Task List

We can also add and dispatch tasks here in lieu of a google doc.
