# Chris addendum 2/6/22
# Note that after this code is run, there are a large number of NAs in the
# circuit variable (and they don't seem to be from the 4th circuit). This is
# because a number of name variants aren't in the lists above. The df below
# contains all the court names associated with NA values; you can use it to add
# those names to the appropriate lists. (Looks like there are 59 unique court names
# that are not yet included in the lists)

# But, there is a better and much less cumbersome way to do this that is more
# robust (e.g. will continue to work if we add data and so on.)

# The circuits follow state boundaries. So, you can look for state names in the
# "court" variable, which tells you circuit the court is in. (Refer to a map
# like this to help:
# https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/federal-courts-public/court-website-links
# )

# The huge advantage of this approach is that you do not have to have every
# variation of every district court name - you only need the sate names, which
# are much, much shorter! (You do still have to capture all state name variants,
# though, if there are any)

# Code would look something like this:

### make lists #####
ninth_circuit <- c("California|Arizona|Nevada|Oregon|Washington|Idaho|Montana|Alaksa|Hawaii")
# ^ note that the state names are separated by a pipe | which is a logical OR
# when the list is passed to str_detect, below.
